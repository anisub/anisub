Hello, I'm Anirudh. I'm a Master's graduate in Robotics @ UPenn. 

My interests lie in computer vision and deep learning. I was previously a mechanical engineer for 3 yrs working in automotive seating and general mechanical engineering roles.I left the field to pursue a career in Robotics because I wanted a new challenge and I believe that Robotics especially computer vision and machine learning will push the fold of what can be achieved with technology.

I am currently looking for open positions and I'm always open to collaborating on exiciting tech whenever possible. I am available @ anirudh.l.subramanyam@gmail.com
